Port-Tales
==========

A small game developed (mainly) in 48h during the StunJam. Little wordless tale about octets.

The game come from the joint work of 3 persons:

- Vicent Michel as the main developer
- Cyril Savary as the main level designer
- Yann Asset as a 3D artist (and a little application architecture).
